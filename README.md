This project represents my learning journey in the Rust programming language. I have very little experience with low level languages so I decided to start with the language that seemed - to me - to be picking up steam.

I am using the Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols' _The Rust Programming Language, 2nd Edition_ book. Some of the functions in this repo are challenges at the end of some of the chapters in the book, others are not.
